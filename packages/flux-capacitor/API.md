# aggregateReducers

[packages/flux-capacitor/lib/aggregateReducers.js:13-20](https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor/blob/0cf1c70c9295aea166caa04f35f8effc21d51276/packages/flux-capacitor/lib/aggregateReducers.js#L13-L20 "Source code on GitHub")

Will aggregate multiple reducers to one. Different to redux' `combineReducers`,
since our reducers return a diff to apply to the database, instead of a complete
new state. So this method merges the reducers' resulting diffs to one.

**Parameters**

-   `reducers` **...[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Reducer functions.

Returns **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** Aggregated reducer. Invoking this reducers equals invoking all the input reducers.

# createStore

[packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js:16-39](https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor/blob/0cf1c70c9295aea166caa04f35f8effc21d51276/packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js#L16-L39 "Source code on GitHub")

Creates a store that manages the event log as well as the reduced tables.<br/>
Never mutate the database's tables manually. Always call `.dispatch()` on
this store instead.

**Parameters**

-   `reducer` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** `(collection: Collection, event: Event) => Changeset`
-   `database` **Database** As returned by `connectTo` (`flux-capacitor-sequelize` package)
-   `enhancer` **\[[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)]** Used to supply middleware(s). Signature:
                                   `(createStore: Function) => (reducer: Function, database: Database) => Store`

Returns **[Store](#store)** Store instance.

# eventLogReducer

[packages/flux-capacitor/lib/eventLogReducer.js:16-19](https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor/blob/0cf1c70c9295aea166caa04f35f8effc21d51276/packages/flux-capacitor/lib/eventLogReducer.js#L16-L19 "Source code on GitHub")

Default eventlog reducer. Just adds every event to the `Events` collection.

**Parameters**

-   `database` **Database** 
-   `event` **[Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)** 

**Examples**

```javascript
const aggregatedReducer = aggregateReducers(rootReducer, eventLogReducer)
const database = await connectToDatabase()

return createStore(aggregatedReducer, database)
```

Returns **Changeset** 

# Store

[packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js:124-126](https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor/blob/0cf1c70c9295aea166caa04f35f8effc21d51276/packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js#L124-L126 "Source code on GitHub")

**Properties**

-   `dispatch` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** 
-   `getDatabase` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** 
-   `subscribe` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** 

# Store.dispatch

[packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js:61-80](https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor/blob/0cf1c70c9295aea166caa04f35f8effc21d51276/packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js#L61-L80 "Source code on GitHub")

Dispatch an event or an array of events. In case you dispatch an event array
all events will be reduced using a shared transaction. If one fails, none
of the events will be applied/persisted.

**Parameters**

-   `event` **([Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) \| [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)>)** 

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)>>** 

# Store.getDatabase

[packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js:88-90](https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor/blob/0cf1c70c9295aea166caa04f35f8effc21d51276/packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js#L88-L90 "Source code on GitHub")

Return the `Database` instance used.

Returns **Database** 

# Store.subscribe

[packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js:101-116](https://github.com/flux-capacitor/flux-capacitor/blob/0cf1c70c9295aea166caa04f35f8effc21d51276/packages/flux-capacitor/lib/createStore.js#L101-L116 "Source code on GitHub")

Subscribe to store, so your listener gets called whenever events have been dispatched.
Passing an array of events to the listener, since you can dispatch an array of events
(instead of a single one) and they will share the same database transaction.

**Parameters**

-   `listener` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** `(events: Array<Event>) => void`

Returns **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** unsubscribe `() => void`
